This project was done in collaboration with two other group members for a course during the Winter Semester for Jan-April 2025. 

Note: to be able to view the project, it must be opened on the UBC CS server. As of now we have not set up a way to view it on one local machine. 

##Description of the Project: 

#Biome Database

The application aims to model the biotic and abiotic components of
different bioregions, called biomes, in British Columbia and how they
interact. Formally, a biome is a community of flora and fauna that occupies
a major habitat, with examples including the biomes Tundra, Temperate
Rainforest, etc. Our application includes entities under this umbrella such
as organisms, climate, and soil type, and relationships such as how a
spanning geographic barrier can result in speciation (separation of species)
within these biomes. The final project allows users to observe the
relationship between multiple attributes present in biomes, such as the
relationship between temperature and precipitation, and many other biotic
and abiotic factors.

Visitors can view tables and their data in a clean, easy to read format and
query the data through a user-friendly interface. In addition, they can also
choose to manipulate some table data by adding, deleting, and or updating
data values using buttons. This allows users from all backgrounds of
education to be able to interact with and access information about the
biomes of British Columbia.
