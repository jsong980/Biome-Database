# BIOME DATABASE
The application aims to model the biotic and abiotic components of different bioregions, called biomes, in British Columbia and how they interact. Formally, a biome is a community of flora and fauna that occupies a major habitat, with examples including the biomes Tundra, Temperate Rainforest, etc. Our application includes entities under this umbrella such as organisms, climate, and soil type, and relationships such as how a spanning geographic barrier can result in speciation (separation of species) within these biomes. The final project allows users to observe the relationship between multiple attributes present in biomes, such as the relationship between temperature and precipitation, and many other biotic and abiotic factors.
Visitors can view tables and their data in a clean, easy to read format and query the data through a user-friendly interface. In addition, they can also choose to manipulate some table data by adding, deleting, and or updating data values using buttons. This allows users from all backgrounds of education to be able to interact with and access information about the biomes of British Columbia.
